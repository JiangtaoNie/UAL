# UAL-Unsupervised-adaptation-learning
Unsupervised Adaptation Learning for Hyperspectral Imagery Super-resolution

The main process of the proposed UAL framework contains two steps, first is use the "Train_FusionModel.py" to train the Fusionmodel. Second, we utilize the pre-trained Fusionmodel to provide the initial input of the adaptor network and then we train the adaptor under unsupervised mode to generate the specific reconstructed HR HSI.
